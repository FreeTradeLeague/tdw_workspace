The data set consists of People, Places, Things, and Organizations. In general there are two versions of everything, a 1416 and 1428 version. 

1416 data is the base. 1428 table layouts are exactly the same, but are empty if nothing changes in that cell. For example, the dob field for a person does not change. 

Where possible, the database naming scheme uses lower case alpha. Separators are underscores '_'. For example, table 'places_1428'. 

Detailed comments are in each table's definitions. There are separate files to be read to insert the actual data. For exmaple, the file 'places_1428_ddl.sql' reads 'places_1428_data.sql'.



In general, I'm still working on my normlization skills. Feel free to comment.  :)
